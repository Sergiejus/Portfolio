                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is HTML?</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">(MDN, 2022)</a>.</p>

                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS is a declarative programming language allows web designers, developer, bloggers, and so forth to make websites unique and attractive. CSS gives us the opportunity to play with a page layout, adjust colors and fonts, add effects to images, etc.</p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays web developers rarely write vanilla CSS, they often use CSS preprocessors or frameworks to leverage cooked styles and coordinate more efficiently with dynamic data coming from JavaScript.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is boring, there’s no doubt about that, but learning history is a powerful step to embrace something and being really good at it. Let me tell you a brief story about CSS history.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994 while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and the rest is history. CSS was not the only styling language in development at the time, but the very element of cascading and developing sequence is what set it apart from the rest.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS is a domain-specific, declarative programming language; it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media; it can control the layout, colors, and fonts of multiple web pages all at once <a href="https://ageek.dev/css-evolution#:~:text=CSS%20(Cascading%20Style%20Sheets)%20was,it%20apart%20from%20the%20rest">(Ageek, 2021)</a>.</p>

                <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites. Client-side languages are those whose action takes place on the user's computer, rather than on the server.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript is versatile enough to be used for a variety of different applications, like software, hardware controls, and servers. JavaScript is most known for being a web-based language, because it's native to the web browser. The web browser can naturally understand the language, like how a native English speaker can naturally understand English.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript has evolved over the past 25 years to become a versatile and accessible programming language for working with web browsers. Developers use JavaScript to build complex interactive websites and browser games, and to connect servers to websites and web applications. Because of this versatility, it’s easy to see why this language is the most commonly used programming language in the world <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for">(Meltzer, 2005)</a>.</p>
