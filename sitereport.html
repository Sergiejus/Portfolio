        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started learning HTML and CSS as a part of a Web Development course in the second half of my first year at the University of Northampton. It was my first encounter with Web development, as I had previously learned only object-oriented programming.</p>
        <h4>Work in progress</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the first week, I have started implementing the knowledge I have gained at lectures and have used it as a foundation for my web project. I have decided to look for a nice background picture first and then work my way around it with the rest of the page. Since the background colours were quite dark, I decided to go for the white buttons to make sure they were visible. I did have a look at several portfolio pages from around the web, looking for inspiration. There were many exciting designs, and I could see some features that I could use on my website in the future.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did encounter some issues with the grid, but these issues were caused mainly by a lack of experience from my side. But after some time, I managed to overcome the problems and made sure the grid was fully functional.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on this project, I found many different ways to make the code work. And this makes CSS even more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website will be updated in the future as my knowledge of CSS and JS grows. I feel there is plenty of space for improvement, and I'm looking forward to future challenges.</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I'm satisfied with my webpage, and I'm happy that all the theoretical knowledge from the lectures came in handy. The hints and tips from the lecturer gave me a chance to improve the webpage and bring some excellent features to it. The validation websites gave me a chance to double-check my code and helped me to avoid rookie mistakes. Below I'm proving the screenshots of validation.</p>
